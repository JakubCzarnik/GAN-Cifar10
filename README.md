# CIFAR-10 GAN in TensorFlow
This repository contains an educational implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset using the TensorFlow library. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a learning resource for understanding GANs and their application in image generation.

## Repository Structure

- `datatools.py`: Utility scripts for loading and preprocessing data from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- `model.py`: Class and functions to build the GAN model.

- `train.py`: Logic for training the GAN model, including data loading, model creation, and training process.
